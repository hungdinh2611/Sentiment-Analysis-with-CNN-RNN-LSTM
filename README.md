# Sentiment-Analysis-with-CNN-RNN-LSTM
This repository explores Sentiment Analysis through three popular deep learning architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM). It provides end-to-end implementation for text sentiment classification, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, word embeddings (GloVe/Word2Vec), and sequence padding.
Model Implementations:
CNN: Captures local patterns in text.
RNN: Models sequential dependencies.
LSTM: Captures long-term dependencies in text.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
Customizable Pipeline: Easily adapt for new datasets and embedding methods.
Use Cases:
Analyze sentiment in movie reviews, social media posts, and customer feedback.
Compare the performance of CNN, RNN, and LSTM for NLP tasks.
